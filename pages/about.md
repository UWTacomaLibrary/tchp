## About the Tacoma Community History Project

The Tacoma Community History Project gathers oral histories created by University of Washington Tacoma students enrolled in courses taught by Professor Michael Honey.

Since 1990, the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences Program has offered courses in oral history at both the undergraduate and the graduate levels. In these classes, students learn the methodology of conducting oral history, interview community members, and compile projects that document the history of local individuals, organizations, and communities. The collection includes over sixty projects on churches, labor unions, military institutions, ethnic communities, neighborhoods, businesses, civic leaders, and prominent citizens in Tacoma and the South Puget Sound. Over fifty are now available digitally through the UW Libraries Digital Collections.

This is a growing collection: future students will have the option to deposit projects in the Library and make them available through this online collection. If you are a student participating in this class, please visit the class guide, which provides recommended specifications for contributing to the Tacoma Community History Project.

To see a hard copy of an original project, please bring the project's call number to the Circulation Desk at the UW Tacoma Library. A complete list of all of the projects with their call numbers can be found on the online guide to the Tacoma Community History Project.
