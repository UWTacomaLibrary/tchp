Disease would continue to wage war against the residents of the City of Destiny until the Fannie C. Paddock Memorial Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital were built in 1882 and 1891, respectively. Both organizations developed meaningful relationships with their community and ignited a behind-the-scenes competition which would benefit both patient and physician. Almost 100 years later, Tacoma was cared for predominantly by primary care physicians. It had just started to see an influx of medical specialists via Madigan Army Medical Center when the city was hit by HIV in 1983. With no effective cure at the time, Tacoma did its best to cope with the disease and its associated complications, and the infectious disease specialists were on the forefront. One of these few physicians was Dr. Peter Marsh. Born in Chicago in 1949, he was inspired to become a doctor as a young boy by the Dr. Kildare film series. Arriving in Tacoma in 1981, he would find himself in the middle of handling the AIDS epidemic, supporting patients as best as he could before they succumbed to the disease; that is, until the introduction of antiretroviral medications. Now able to effectively cure patients, Dr. Marsh found new life in his work and continued to serve his community until retirement in 2015. With the epidemic under control, Tacoma still utilizes what it learned from that chaotic era to stand prepared for anything thrown its way.",,,Downtown,47.246605,-122.436963,Tacoma Community History Project,,record,compound_object,eng,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,"Individuals may use project materials for scholarly or research purposes, according to the provisions of fair use, but reproducing, publishing, or broadcasting any oral history project materials requires permission.

Businesses such as hardware stores, banks, small department stores, appliance dealers, butchers, markets, cleaners, clothing stores, and restaurants lined the streets.

The origin of the idea of seeding the United States with Socialist Communities came from an organization led by Eugene V Debs. Debs was a veteran of the labor troubles that gripped the nation beginning in the 1880's and culminated with the deaths of thirteen workers during the Pullman Strike. Debs began to believe that the only hope for the workingman was Socialism. With that in mind the national Socialist organization looked for opportunities to spread the Socialism, Washington State was selected as the site of the colony, chosen because of its history of labor activism and a smaller population that would be sympathetic to the cause. Thus was born the town/colony of Brotherhood, a name that was soon surrendered for the commonly used, Burley. Plagued with troubles from the onset, the colony lasted only 15 years. This is story of a community that has survived, not so much physically, but in spirit, a spirit that still holds this small community together today. That spirit can be seen in the words of Barbara Laxson who is a longtime resident who lives in one of the original homes built by the colony where an oral history was recorded. It can also be heard in the words of Maria Moore, an American citizen born in Mexico who lives now in Burley. Mrs. Moore, is a former member of the Burley Community Association the group that is charged with maintaining the community properties, her interview was conducted in the community park.

chp201706,,Still Fighting after All These Years: A Puyallup Tribal Member's Perspective,"Shippentower-Games, Nancy","Williamson, Rachael",2017,"Nancy Shippentower-Games is a member of the Puyallup Tribe in Washington State. Nancy's parents are Donald and Janet McCloud. She has seven siblings and grew up on the banks of the Nisqually River and Puyallup Rivers and currently resides in Yelm, Washington. Nancy grew up during the fishing wars that took place on both the Nisqually and Puyallup Rivers. Her mother Janet McCloud and her uncle, Billy Frank Jr., were very active advocates during the battle over salmon. She remembers vividly the violence, racism and injustices that she and her people suffered as they fought for what was rightfully theirs. By revisiting the circumstances and propositions set forth in the Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854, a better understanding of what the Puyallup and Nisqually tribes have been fighting for comes into focus. While the Boldt Decision of 1974 was a turning point for Northwest Tribes, concerns such as climate change, overpopulation, and proposals such as the LNG plant in Tacoma continue to put the salmon runs at risk.",,,Puyallup Reservation,47.23648939411235,-122.40910344939977,Tacoma Community History Project,,record,compound_object,eng,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/,"Individuals may use project materials for scholarly or research purposes, according to the provisions of fair use, but reproducing, publishing, or broadcasting any oral history project materials requires permission.

This research focuses on immigrant working women from the Middle East, whose life journeys are filled in with several traumas, some intensified during the pandemic. This paper provides two oral history records of two Iranian American working mothers, Aida Mohajer and Mrs. Ebrahimi, who carry historical traumas experienced in two different countries with two different cultures, i.e. Iran, and the USA.
